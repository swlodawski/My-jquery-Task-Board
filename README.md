# My-jquery-Task-Board
This is my fifth challenge for a jquery interactive task board.

#Jquery Taskbar Project
   1. This is a jQuery task board project I was asked to create.
   2. It will allow a user to enter task title, date due and task description information 
        into a form modal which will render it to the task board.
   3. It will allow the user the ability to drag and drop individual tasks and then delete 
        them when they are completed.

## Installation

1. I created this project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as by integrating the CSS 
      Bootstrap Library and jsDate from the jQuery ui library.
2. I deployed the project on gitpages for review and public consumption.
3. I will include the gitpages deployed page url and screenshots of my project demo in the  
     next section.

## Usage

1. This project can be used to create a task board and drag each created task card among 
    several categories. They can then be deleted after completed.
2. Deployed Webpage url: https://swlodawski.github.io/My-jquery-Task-Board/
3, Screenshots of deployed page and demo:
